**EMS-ESP** is an open-source firmware for the Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontroller that communicates with **EMS** (Energy Management System) based equipment from manufacturers like Bosch, Buderus, Nefit, Junkers, Worcester and Sieger.

This project is the specifically for the ESP32. Compared with the previous ESP8266 (version 2) release it has the following enhancements:

- Ethernet Support
- Pre-configured circuit board layouts
- Supports writing EMS values directly from within Web UI
- Mock API server for faster offline development and testing
- Improved API and MQTT commands
- Improvements to Dallas temperature sensors
- Embedded log tracing in the Web UI
